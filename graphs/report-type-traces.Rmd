Promise types follow the type designations in ``Rinternals.h``.  
<!--**α→β** indicates that type **α** variously evaluates to type **β**.  -->
**α** indicates that the promise contains the expression of type **α**.  
**PROM→α** indicates that the promise contains a promise which contains the expression of type **α**, etc.  
**BCODE →α** indicates that it's a byte-compiled expression that was originally of type **α**.    
**SYM→α** indicates that it's a symbol that points to an expression of type **α**.  
**...** is a type that could not has not been correctly determined.
