# Promise Dynamic Tracing Experiment

This repository is the control center for 
- **executing** promise tracer on corpus of R code
- **gathering** data generated by the tracer in an organized way
- **analyzing** the data to get insights

## Setup

The execution and analysis pipeline itself depends on some R packages. 
These packages can be installed by running the following command:

`$ make install-dependencies`

## Corpus

To run the tracer on a list of R packages installed with `R-dyntrace`, run the
following command:

`$ make update-corpus`

This generates a list of packages in `scripts/corpus.txt`. This can also be edited
manually.

## Analysis

To run the analysis, execute the following command:

`$ make analyze ANALYSIS=<analysis-name>`

`analysis-name` can be any of the following:

- `function-strictness`
