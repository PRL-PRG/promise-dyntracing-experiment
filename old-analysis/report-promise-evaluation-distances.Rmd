# Promise evaluation distances

<!--Effective distance is the distance from the call where a promise originated to the call in which it was evaluated. It is measured along the call graph (along inbound edges).  Since the data is gathered from a trace, the call graph is a tree.-->

<div style="font-size: 50%">
  **n** - distance from the function for which a promise was created and the function in which it was evaluated    
**NA** - promise was not executed, there is no distance measure (a virgin promise)  
**-1** - promise was executed but there is no path from the origin to the point of evaluation (an escaped promise)
